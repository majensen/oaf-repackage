o INSTALLATION

  Ornitine decarboxylase Antizyme Finder (OAF) has been installed
 on many forms of Unix, MacOS X and probably on Win9X/NT/2000/XP.


o SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

 - perl 5.005 or later.

 - Bioperl modules: OAF uses functionality provided
  in Bioperl modules. (see http://www.bioperl.org/)

   As of May 2016, install BioPerl from CPAN

   cpanm Bio::Perl
   
 - HMMER is mandatory since OAF is base on HMM profiles.
   (see http://hmmer.janelia.org/)

   As of May 2016, check out http://hmmer.org/download.html. You need hmmpfam.
   In Ubuntu,

   sudo apt-get install hmmer2
   sudo ln -s /usr/bin/hmm2pfam /usr/local/bin/hmmpfam

   seems to work

 - FASTA is mandatory if you plan to use sequence longer than 20 kb.
   (see ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/fasta/)

   As of May 2016, see
   ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/fasta/CURRENT/

 - BLAST is mandatory if you plan to search through a database,
   except if you use the NCBI remote BLAST server.
   (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/download.shtml)

   As of May 2016, use the blast+ programs at
   ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/

   In Ubuntu,
   
   sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+

  After installing  HMMER, FASTA and BLAST packages on your system,
 you may edit the environmental variable $HMMERDIR, $FASTADIR and
 $BLASTDIR or your $PATH variable to point to the HMMER, FASTA and
 BLAST directories repectively. Ensure that users have execute
 privileges for those programs. 


o INSTALLING OAF

   The advantage of this approach is it's stepwise, so
   it's easy to stop and analyse in case of any problem.

   Download, then unpack the tar file. For example:

     bunzip2 oaf-1.0.6.tar.bz2
     tar xvf oaf-1.0.6.tar
     cd oaf-1.0.6

   Now issue the make commands:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make            
     sudo make install    
 
   To 'make install' you need write permission in the perl5/site_perl/ 
   source area. Quite often this will require you becoming root, so
   you will want to talk to your systems manager if you don't have 
   the necessary privileges.
