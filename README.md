[oaf-1.0.6](http://recode.ucc.ie/oaf/)
===========

This is a fix of the distribution of oaf so that it works with
"modern" (or at least what you can get on
[CPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/BioPerl)) BioPerl.

Examine [INSTALL](./INSTALL) for latest places to obtain the dependencies.

For reasons known only to the original author, oaf.pl is found in
[examples](./examples). The files oaz.* in [examples](./examples) must
be present in the same directory as oaf.pl.
